## README: Simple HTML Website Deployment

### Project Overview

This project is a basic HTML website designed for easy deployment. It includes a single HTML file that contains all the necessary CSS and JavaScript to make the website fully functional and visually appealing.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML**: The core structure of the website.
- **CSS**: Styling directly included in the HTML file for layout and design.
- **JavaScript**: Scripts included within the HTML file for interactivity and functionality.

### Deployment Instructions

#### Prerequisites

- **Azure Account**: You'll need an Azure account to deploy the HTML file using Azure services.

#### Steps to Deploy

1. **Prepare Your HTML File**
   - Ensure your HTML file (`index.html`) is ready with all CSS and JavaScript embedded or linked correctly.

2. **Upload to Azure**
   - Log in to your Azure account.
   - Navigate to **Azure Static Web Apps** or **Azure Blob Storage** (if using a static website feature).
   - Create a new Static Web App or Blob Storage account if you donâ€™t already have one.
   - Upload your `index.html` file.

3. **Configure the Static Web App or Blob Storage**
   - Set the default document to `index.html` to ensure it loads correctly.

4. **Access Your Website**
   - Once deployed, navigate to the provided URL by Azure to view your website.

### Usage

Visit the deployed URL in any web browser to access and interact with your website.

### Troubleshooting

- **Page Not Loading**: Double-check that `index.html` is set as the default document in Azure settings.
